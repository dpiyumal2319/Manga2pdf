# Manga to PDF Converter

A Python script that downloads manga chapters from websites and converts them into PDF format for offline reading.

## Features

- üîΩ Downloads all images from a manga chapter URL
- üìÑ Creates multi-page PDFs (handles PIL's image size limitations)
- üñºÔ∏è Filters out ads and small unwanted images
- üîÑ Fallback to PNG images if PDF creation fails
- üì± Handles various image URL formats and relative paths
- ‚ö° Progress tracking with detailed logging

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Internet connection for downloading images

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Edit the `main()` function in `main.py` to set your desired manga chapter URL:
```python
chapter_url = "https://example-manga-site.com/chapter-1/"
output_pdf = "Chapter_1.pdf"
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the code:

- `max_height` in `create_pdf_pages()`: Maximum height per PDF page (default: 60,000 pixels)
- `quality` in `save_as_pdf()`: JPEG compression quality (default: 85)
- Image filtering thresholds in `download_images()`

## How It Works

1. **Fetches HTML**: Downloads the webpage and parses it for image URLs
2. **Downloads Images**: Downloads all manga page images with proper headers
3. **Filters Content**: Removes small images (ads, icons) based on size and dimensions
4. **Creates Pages**: Groups images into pages that don't exceed PIL's limits
5. **Generates PDF**: Creates a multi-page PDF or falls back to individual PNG files

## Supported Sites

This script works with websites that serve manga images directly in `<img>` tags. It may need modifications for sites that:
- Use JavaScript to load images dynamically
- Require authentication
- Use non-standard image serving methods

## File Structure

```
manga-to-pdf/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/             # Generated PDFs (created automatically)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No images downloaded:**
- Check if the website URL is correct
- The site might have changed its structure
- Try adding delay between requests if being rate-limited

**PDF creation fails:**
- The script will automatically fall back to PNG images
- Check available disk space
- Verify image dimensions aren't corrupted

**Download errors:**
- Some sites block automated requests
- Try modifying the User-Agent string
- Check your internet connection

### Error Messages

- `"Maximum supported image dimension is 65500 pixels"`: The script handles this automatically by splitting into multiple pages
- `"broken data stream"`: Fixed by the multi-page approach
- `"No image URLs found"`: The website structure might have changed
